<p>5.1 What are cookies?<br />Cookies are small text files that are permanently or temporarily stored on your device (computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our Website. This enables the Website to remember specific entries and settings (e.g. language, preferences, statistics) over a certain period of time, so you don&rsquo;t have to re-enter them when you use our Website.</p>
<p>First party cookies are cookies set by our Website and therefore, only our Website can read them. In addition, a Website may potentially use external services which also set their own cookies. These are called third-party cookies.<br />Permanent cookies remain on your device after you close your session until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.<br />5.2 Which cookies do we use and why?<br />Essential cookies: These cookies are technically required for the functionality of the Website and the provision of the Website content and services.<br />Statistical cookies: These cookies gather information about your technical behavior on the Website (e.g. how often the Website is visited, the security of the Website, error messages and the Website display in different browsers).<br />Within and to the extent under the scope of application of the GDPR, the data processed by cookies for the aforementioned purposes is based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
<p>5.3 Simple Analytics<br />To obtain information about the user&rsquo;s behavior on our Website, we use Simple Analytics. This analytics software only gives us insight about the user in general, but not about individuals, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information.</p>

Most browsers allow you to delete cookies, prevent their installation or generate a warning before a cookie is installed.

Accordingly, we store all the data you provide on secure servers. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technical developments.<br />Access to Personal Data is limited to those employees and/or third parties assigned with processing tasks who therefore need to know about this data. These employees and/or third parties are subject to confidentiality undertakings and/or data processing agreements and must comply with applicable data protection laws.<br />We use SSL encryption for reasons of security and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as the requests you send to us as an investment operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL encryption is activated, third parties cannot read the data that you transmit to us.<br />However, it must be stated that no technical and organizational measures can fully eliminate security risks connected with transmission of information over the internet.<br />You are responsible for keeping the account information for accessing any of our networks operated confidential.

Rights of Data Subjects<br />9.1 General provisions<br />A &ldquo;Data Subject&rdquo; is any natural person to whom the Person Data refers to.<br />As the Data Subject, you may assert various claims against us in accordance with the applicable national and international law. To meet these claims, we will need to process your Personal Data again.<br />To exercise these rights, please contact us as specified in Section 1. Exercising these rights requires that you are able to prove your identity (e.g., by a copy of identification documents when your identity is not evident otherwise or cannot be verified in another way).<br />Any requests will be free of charge, provided we do not incur unexpected and inadequate costs for providing you with details of your Personal Data. If exercising certain rights incurs costs for you, we will notify you thereof in advance.<br />Where possible, we will fulfill such a request within thirty (30) days (art. 25 para. 7 FADP, art. 12 para. 3 GDPR).<br />9.2 Your rights<br />a) Right to request information (art. 25 FADP, art. 15 GDPR) relating to you. In particular, you may request information about:</p>
<p>the identity and the contact details of the controller;<br />the processed personal data as such;<br />the purposes of the data processing;<br />the retention period for the personal data or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this period;<br />the origin of your data if it has not been collected by us;<br />the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details;<br />the categories of recipients to whom your information has been or will be disclosed;<br />the existence of a right to rectification, deletion, restriction of or to object to data processing;<br />the existence of a right to lodge a complaint. &rarr; Templates are available on the website of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (German, English).<br />b) You can immediately request the rectification of incorrect or incomplete Personal Data stored by us (art. 32 para. 1 FADP, art. 16 GDPR). You will be informed of the rectification, unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>c) You can request the deletion of your Personal Data, unless the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and information, for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or to assert exercise or defend legal claims (art. 17 GDPR).</p>
<p>d) If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data if there are reasons for doing so which arise from your particular situation or if the objection is to the direct advertising. In the latter case, you have a general right to object, which is implemented by us without stating a special situation (art. 32 para. 2 lit. a FADP, art. 21 GDPR).</p>
<p>e) You can request the restriction of the processing of your Personal Data if the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful but you refuse to delete it, we no longer need the data but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or you have lodged a complaint to the processing pursuant to art. 21 GDPR (Art. 32 para. 3 FADP, Art. 18 GDPR).</p>
<p>f) You can receive the Personal Data that you have provided to us, in a structured, common and machine-readable format or request its transmission to another controller (art. 28 para. 2 FADP, art. 20 GDPR).</p>
<p>g) You can withdraw your consent to us at any time. As a result, we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent in the future (art. 7 para. 3 GDPR).</p>
<p>Please note that we reserve the right to enforce statutory restrictions on our part, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest (insofar as we may invoke such interests), are bound to maintain confidentiality or need the data for asserting claims (art. 26 para. 1 and 2 FADP, art. 27 FADP).</p>
